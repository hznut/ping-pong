This program simulates Ping-Pong game. However the rules of the game have been bent a little bit:

1) The game is of 11 points. Whoever scores 11 points first wins.
2) There is no special case for a deuce (10-10).
3) Whoever wins the rally/point, gets to serve.

Assuming the project directory ping-pong is placed under <some-dir>/, let <app-home> refer to the <some-dir>/ping-pong/ path. 

Start the game simply by doing:

cd <app-home>
mvn clean package
#The above command will package a jar and place it under target/ directory.

java -jar target/ping-pong-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar hz.nut.ping.pong.Game
